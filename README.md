# Lingua
English to Pidgin English(Cameroon) Sequence-to-Sequence Translator Model

## Overview

Lingua is an open-source project that focuses on building a sequence-to-sequence translator model using transformers to translate text from English to Pidgin English(Cameroon). Cameroon Pidgin English is a widely spoken creole language in Cameroon, making this project a valuable resource for linguistic diversity.

## Features

- **Sequence-to-Sequence Learning:** Implements sequence-to-sequence learning for translation tasks, allowing for more context-aware and accurate translations.
- **Cameroon Pidgin English Support:** Specifically designed for translating English text into Cameroon Pidgin English, catering to the linguistic needs of the Cameroon community.
- **Open Source:** The entire project is open-source, allowing collaboration and contributions from the community to improve and expand the translation capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.13 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (Choose your preferred deep learning framework)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FotieMConstant/lingua.git
cd lingua
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Dataset

The effectiveness of Lingua relies heavily on the quality and diversity of the dataset. As the project progresses, we aim to collect and curate a comprehensive dataset of English-Cameroon Pidgin English pairs. Contributions to the dataset are highly encouraged, and details on how to contribute will be provided in the `dataset` directory.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's improving the translation model, enhancing the dataset, or refining the documentation, your help is valuable. Please follow the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
